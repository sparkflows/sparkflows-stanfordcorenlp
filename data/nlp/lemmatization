How could you be seeing into my eyes like open doors?
You led me down into my core where I've became so numb
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and led it back home
You woke me up inside
Called my name and saved me from the dark
You have bidden my blood and it ran
Before I would become undone
You saved me from the nothing I've almost become
You were bringing me to life
Now that I knew what I'm without
You can've just left me
You breathed into me and made me real
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
You were bringing me to life.
